## About

**sorting** is a small web application for visualization of sorting algorithms

It is implemented without any framework or library except my own lightweight vanilla package that probably could be just one among other source files of current sources

## Motivation

**sorting** is a pet-project for fun and to gain new knowledges

## Usage

```
npm run bulid
npm start
google-chrome http://localhost:8080
```

or

```
npm run build
google-chrome build/index.html
```
