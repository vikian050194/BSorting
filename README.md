## About

**sorting** is a small web application for visualization of sorting algorithms

It is implemented without any framework or library except my own lightweight vanilla package that probably could be just one among other source files of current sources

## Motivation

**sorting** is a pet-project and my own handmade bicycle

I am really happy to work on it and gain new knowledges

That's it

## Usage

Nothing special, just

```
npm start
```

or

```
npm run build
```

and open `index.html` from `build` directory
